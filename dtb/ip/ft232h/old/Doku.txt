FT232H Register Definition
==========================

WRITE
-----
Reg 0 (16 Bit): Load 8 bit-data (00XXh) into transmit-FIFO. Last word should be 80XXh (gives the USB-chip a signal to immediately send data from transmit-fifo). If transmit-FIFO is full, waitrequest will be activated.
Reg 1 (16 Bit): Redirected to Reg 0

READ
----
Reg 0 (16 Bit): Read data from receive-FIFO if available (00XXh), otherwise 8000h will be readed.
Reg 1 (16 Bit): 8000h will be readed if transmit-FIFO (!) is full, otherwise 0000h will be readed.


Example
=======

if(IORD_16DIRECT(FT232H_0_BASE, 2) == 0x0000) {
	IOWR_16DIRECT(FT232H_0_BASE, 0, ('H' | 0x8000));
}
else {
	printf("Buffer full");
}

Make sure that usb_clk is a global clock.
